# BST Default firmware

(**Unofficial**) Default BST firmware for [Application Board 3.1](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/tools/application-board-3-1/) or 
[3.0](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/tools/application-board-3-0/) hardware.

The boards are shipped pre-programmed with the firmware.

If you would like to restore the firmware to its default state
(possibly after some experimentation), 
here you can find the HEX files for programming.

## Program the board

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/umrx-sw/bst-default-firmware/releases) and download the `*.hex` files.

2. install the `nrfjprog` tool which is part of 
[nRF-Command-Line-Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/).
The `nrfutil` tool seems to have similar functionality, but reading and writing the memory addresses 
does not work.

3. Program the firmware

3.1 For Application Board 3.1, run

```bash
nrfjprog -f nrf52 --program application_board_v3_rev1_fw.hex --sectorerase --verify
```

3.2 For Application Board 3.0, run:

```bash
nrfjprog -f nrf52 --program application_board_v3_rev0_fw.hex --sectorerase --verify
```

4. Write the bootloader address to the (`UICR.BOOTLOADERADDR`, `0x10001014` in the reference manual: `UICR.NRFFW[0]`):
```bash
nrfjprog -f nrf52 --memwr 0x10001014 --val 0x000F0000
```
